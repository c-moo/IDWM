I'm making a small chrome extension for [Cine2Nerdle](https://www.cinenerdle2.app/battle), a game where you pick a movie that has actor from the previously picked movie.

The extension queries the TMDB api for a list of movies and actors. Also you need your own api key because I'm not sharing mine.

Work in progress
